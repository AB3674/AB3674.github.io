      <p>I'm no stranger to going head first into things that are unfamiliar to me. Give me a challenge and 
        I'll give it my best shot and then some. Making mistakes is a price I'm willing to pay to become
        Wizard of Web!

        <h2>What am I yearning to do</h2>

        <p>Where do I start?! The world of web fascinates me to full length: whole nine yards from full stack to 
          ethical hacking. Greater leap towards animation and UI design is also on my list of warfare fronts!
